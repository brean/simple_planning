# simple_planning
Run different planner using docker. To quickly test and benchmark your pddl on different planner.

Included planner:
 - FF v2.3 with enhancements from University Saarland (See website of [Prof. Dr. JÃ¶rg Hoffmann](https://fai.cs.uni-saarland.de/hoffmann/ff.html) original source can be downloaded [here](https://fai.cs.uni-saarland.de/hoffmann/ff/FF-v2.3.tgz)), released under GNU General Public License 3
 - popf from [here](https://github.com/fmrico/popf), which is used by KCL planning group / [ROSPlan](https://kcl-planning.github.io/ROSPlan/) released under GNU General Public License 2
 - popf2 from [here](https://github.com/mortacious/popf2), as described in ICAPS 2010 paper ["Forward-Chaining Partial-Order Planning."](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICAPS/article/view/13403/13252), released under GNU General Public License 3

**simple_planning** was initiated and is currently developed at the [Robotics Innovation Center](http://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/startpage.html) of the [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)](http://www.dfki.de) in Bremen.

## Motivation
Unify how to call a planer and benchmark different planner quickly.

### Installation
just install docker and docker-compose, then run `docker-compose build`.

## Getting Started
Just modify the `problem.pddl` and `domain.pddl` in the pddl-folder accordingly then build and run the docker-container for the planner you want to use (Example: `docker-compose run ff`, see docker-compose.yml for all planner and their details).

the pddl-folder is linked to your docker container so you can modifiy the files without the need of rebuilding the container.
The output is written on the terminal.
